### üß± **2. ATM Layers & Architecture**

#### A. **ATM Layers**
- **Physical Layer**
  - Converts cells to bits/signals.
  - Two sublayers:
    - **TC (Transmission Convergence)** ‚Äì Handles framing, error detection.
    - **PMD (Physical Medium Dependent)** ‚Äì Electrical/optical transmission.

- **ATM Layer**
  - Manages cell switching.
  - Uses **VCI/VPI** for routing.
  - Maintains QoS.

- **AAL (ATM Adaptation Layer)**
  - **Breaks** data into 48-byte payloads.
  - **Reassembles** cells at the receiver.
  - Provides error checking, flow control, and QoS.

### üß© **3. Types of AAL**

| Type     | Use Case                   | Feature                                  |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| AAL1     | Constant Bit Rate (CBR)    | For real-time like voice/video            |
| AAL2     | Variable Bit Rate (VBR)    | Compressed voice                          |
| AAL3/4   | Data traffic               | Error detection & control                 |
| AAL5     | Most common for data       | Lightweight, for IP packets               |

### üì° **4. ATM Interfaces**

| Interface | Role                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| **UNI**   | Connects user devices to ATM network         |
| **NNI**   | Connects ATM switches (within/between networks) |

---

### üåê **5. B-ISDN (Broadband ISDN)**

- Based on ATM architecture.
- Similar to OSI model: **Physical ‚Üí ATM ‚Üí AAL**
- Designed for high-speed multimedia transmission.

---

### üö¶ **6. Asynchronous Systems in Networking**

- No shared clock between sender/receiver.
- Uses **start/stop bits** for data.
- Example: RS-232, UART, Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
- Efficient for **low-speed**, simpler communication.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **7. Modern Applications**

| Technology          | Real-World Use                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **ATM**             | Telecom backbones, banking, video conferencing       |
| **Circuit Switching** | Traditional telephony (PSTN)                        |
| **Packet Switching** | Internet, VoIP, cloud services                       |

---

### üöÄ **8. Why ATM is Used in Public Networks**

- **High-Speed**: Up to 622 Mbps+
- **Predictable Performance**: Fixed cell size
- **Multiprotocol Support**: Voice, video, data
- **QoS**: Traffic classes (CBR, VBR, ABR, UBR)
- **Reliable & Secure**: Good for finance & healthcare

---

### üè¢ **9. How Enterprises Use ATM**

- **WANs**: Connects multiple branches
- **Video Conferencing**: High-quality streaming
- **Backbones for ISPs**
- **Banking & Healthcare**: Secure, real-time data

---

‚úÖ **Quick Revision Tips:**
- ATM = Fixed cells + QoS + good for multimedia  
- Circuit = Fixed path, poor for data-heavy use  
- Packet = Flexible, internet-based, efficient  
- AAL = Converts variable data into fixed ATM cells  
- UNI/NNI = Interfaces between user/network or networks
